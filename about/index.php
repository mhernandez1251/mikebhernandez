    <div id="about-text">My name is Michael Hernandez and I'm a web developer from the Chicagoland area. It took me away to feel confident in saying that, but I AM a web developer.
    My hesitation in owning that title comes from the fact that I am self taught. Now I understand that this may scare you. It may send you running. It may cause you to disregard anything I have to say
    or show you. DO. NOT. MAKE. THAT. MISTAKE. Though unconventional, learning on my own has provided me with tools beyond coding and the ability to build websites (though I do have those tools too).
    Independant learning requires a true passion for the material. The added challenges of this lonely journey are too great for simply a passing interest. I am driven by an insatiable hunger and curiousity for all things coding. I do not view problems as pitfalls to waste away in. I am not deterred by what I don't know. Being wrong
    does not frustrate me. It excites me. Problems are inevidable, but I have the skillset to find a solution. I may not have a piece of paper stating that I am ready, but I do have projects that
    demonstrate my understanding. The world of programming and web development is constantly changing and evolving, and I have to tools to adapt along side it.  <br />Self Taught, Self Motivated, Self Made</div>
